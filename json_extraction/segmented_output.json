      "text": "The successful Isracli use of mini RPV's against Syrian air defenses in 1982, their\ntracking of Gen. Kelley of the Marines in Beirut by a RPV when he moved about the area,\nand the Navy's experience in Lebanon in the early 1980's, particularly the loss of an\naircraft, led Secretary of the Navy John Lehman to order in 1985 that the Navy obtain a\nRPV reconnaissance and gunfire direction capability as soon as possible, using available.\nproven RPV systems. 43 In response, the Navy and Marine Corps rapidly acquired first the\nIsraeli MASTIFF, and more recently the PIONEER. The Navy has apparently successfully\noperated and modified the PIONEERS for use from several types of ships and had\nevaluated the PIONEER in operational exercises.44\nIn the 1970's, the Air Force had the COMPASS COPE program for a long-\nendurance high-altitude RPV to replace the U-2. After a short-time, the Air Force reduced\nfunding for COMPASS COPE, citing high cost and lack of clear mission objectives. In\n1983, DARPA undertook a long endurance RPV program, AMBER, taking advantage of\nnew advances in materials, computers, propulsion, and sensor capabilities.45 While still\nemphasizing endurance and survivability, the AMBER program became a joint effort with\nthe Army and Navy and has produced a variety of RPV's of different sizes for use at high\nand medium altitudes, some of which are capable of autonomous, \"intelligent\" activity.\nDARPA encouraged innovative industry participation in the AMBER program. DARPA\ntransferred AMBER technology to the Navy and the UAV SPO in 1988. Figure 2 shows\none of the AMBER vehicles. Both the AMBER high-altitude RPV and the CONDOR,\nproduced by Boeing Company and supported recently by DARPA, have set new records of\naltitude and endurance for propeller-driven aircraft.

ARPA's success may have been mainly in this timely meeting of the mini-RPV\nchallenge.\nThe Aray's AQUILA program seems to have been only partly influenced by these\nARPA technology demonstrations. Other ARPA mini-RPV programs with the Air Force\nand the Navy seem to have led to Service programs with short lives. However, the Isracli\nMASTIFF, SCOUT, and PIONEER seem to be more direct derivatives of the ARPA\nprogram. In the Navy and Marine Corps procurement of the Israeli RPV's the mini-RPV\ntechnology transfer process seems to have brought the mini-RPV from DARPA nearly full\ncircle.\nIn the mid 1970's comments were made by Navy and Army program managers,\nthat militarized mini-RPV's are not simple modifications of model airplane technology, but\ncloser to the technology of a weapons system.4\n.46 \nTrade-offs between low cost and\nexpendable vehicles, more nearly the original mini-RPV motif, and more complex,\nsurvivable RPV's or high cost manned aircraft are still being debated.\nThe AQUILA development led to a complex, heavy, and costly RPV, which was\nrecently cancelled. The Army's reasons for the AQUILA history are based partly on\nstringent requirements for antijam capability to operate in the NATO theater. Partly also it\nwas due to a change in operational concept, in midstream, from what was mainly a target\ndesignator for a battalion's smart weapons, to this plus a more complex intelligence-\ngathering and electronic warfare device for division-wide use.47 Somewhat the same type\nof evolution occurred, apparently, in the Army's earlier program, in the 1950s. These\nRPV functions seem to have been separated again in more recent Army concepts.48\nDespite the cancellation of AQUILA, the Army continues interest in several RPV programs\nnow under the aegis of the DoD joint RPV (now UAV) program office, set up by\nCongressional directive in the late 1980's, and is apparently planning for a new mini-RPV\nto take the place of AQUILA. Use of an RPV in conjunction with COPPERHEAD was for\na time an important driving force for continued Arm/ RPV effort s.\n46 Capt. Hill, Hearing, ibid., p. 3993 and F.

The Isracli's success led to Secretary of the Navy I chman's\nimpression that a useful RPV capability could be quickly acquired. The threat faced by the\nNavy is not the same as that in the NATO battlefields. The Navy and Marine Corps\nacquired several PIONEER systems, before Congress prohibited further Service RPV\nprocurements.49 Congress and DoD, favorably impressed by the Navy's progress, have\ngiven the Navy responsibility for running the DoD RPV Joint Program Office.50\nPIONEER, however, is not in the competition for the future joint-Service short-range\nRPV.51 It is expected to be superseded by other designs.\nThe AQUILA anti-jam communications systems (MICNS) was developed by the\nsame contractor (Harris) which had made the earlier ICNS used in PRAEIRE. About $2\nmillion was spent by DARPA on the integrated communications and navigation system\n(JCNS) and about $100 million by the Army on MICNS. Trade-offs have had to be nade\nbetween space and weight on RPV's, and antijam capability which depends on the\nmission. 52\nDifficulty has persisted with IR technology for the mini-RPV's. ARPA had\nproblems with the early CALERE and AQUILA at the time of cancellation did not have a\nsatisfactory package.53\nDARPA's reentry into RPV's, the AMBER program, was oriented to larger RPV's\nwith long endurance, low observables and sophisticated sensor technology. AMBER has\nbeen transferred to the Services. The Boeing-developed CONDOR, recently supported by\nDARPA, has aroused considerable interest in the Army and Navy.\nThe DARPA outlay for mini-RPV's, between 1972 and 1977, was nearly $15\nmillion. 54 The Army's outlays for AQUILA were, at the time of cancellation, about $8 00\n 49\n\"Pentagon Considers Buying Additional Pioneer RPVs,\" by John D.
